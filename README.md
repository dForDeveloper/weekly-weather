# [Weekly Weather](https://dfordeveloper.github.io/weekly-weather/)

**Weekly Weather** is a React app that provides you with your weather forecast using data from the Dark Sky and OpenCage Geocoding APIs. You can search for any US city and see the current weather conditions, a graph of the temperature for the next 24 hours, and the forecast for the upcoming week.

## How to Use the App:
  ### As a User:
  - Go to [the website](https://dfordeveloper.github.io/weekly-weather/).
  - You should be automatically redirected to the page for your city where you will see the current weather conditions.
  - Check the graph to see how the temperature will rise and fall over the course of the next 24 hours.
  - Scroll down to see the low and high temperatures for the next seven days.
  - Click on the button for a given day to see more information about that day's weather.
  - Head back to the top of the page to search for any city in the US.
